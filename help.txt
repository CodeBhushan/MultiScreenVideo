give all lappy a particular ip address, and then do ethernet connection, and then run 'local' named file on common server.((all files are written as bash shell script , so it will run only on server having linux on it))
wall video filter option of vlc has been used to display only some part of video on particular computer. https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Advanced_Use_of_VLC/


To stream video in vlc using GUI, server can use rtsp,udp,http.While using udp, server has to give server's ipaddress only, and in other cases leave as it is.
Client has to use following address in case of http and rtsp:- 'server's_ip_address:portno/' ...In case of udp '/' is not needed perhaps and i couldnt run using udp
note:server and client can be connected using adhoc, lan or wifi.


127.0.0.1 is the ipaddress of 'localhost' on each computer....

teamviewer software or VPN can be used to connect to computer even behind the router/gatewAY .

UDP protocol is used in DC++, and it requires direct connection .Eg: ravinder bhawan has one main router_gateway connecting all lappy , so it has own dc++. KB,RGB and RKB has only one combined main router_gateway connecting all lappy, so it has own dc++. There is no dc++ connection between Ravindra and other bhawans.
